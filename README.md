# akta-kurvan
Akta-kurvan  - A demake of achtung die kurve for NES!

This game is a 4-player only game written for NES (NTSC).

PAL version will probably follow.

To run this project you need a nes emulator
I mainly use:

FCEUX (https://fceux.com)

or

Mesen (https://www.mesen.ca/)

If you would like to compile the project you need the nesfab library in the same directory as akta-kurvan

You also need nesfab executable ( I run it with Wine because MAC)

Thx to pubby and Nikku2411 for helping me build this game.
